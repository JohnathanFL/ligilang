-- This is to re-unify the type specifier for compounds

-- First we had `:type:`, then it was `=type=`. We're going back to `:type:` now
-- that `:` is back to being purely punctuation, and we're adding another change:
let x = {:usize:
  let y = 10

  y
}
-- ...you're now able to specify what type a block should evaluate as

-- Now, `()`, `[]`, and `{}` all support the same syntax at their beginnings
