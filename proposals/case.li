-- This is a proposal to remove "enum" as a bind specifier, and replace it with "case"
-- This is directly inspired by reading some Swift code.

-- It's a simple enough change:
let Meal = enum
  case Breakfast, Lunch, Supper
-- And, obviously, short enums are still simply
let Meal = enum (#Breakfast, #Lunch, #Supper)
