-- This is to define the `%` operator

-- Essentially, the `%` operator will expand an `@Atom` (AST node) in the current context:

let add_1 = @list(#+, #x, 1)

var x = 0
let two = %add_1


-- This is basically what the `$` operator did before I swapped it to being a pattern operator.
-- There's still a possibility I might swap them back, but I'd prefer to keep them as-is since
-- patterns will be widely used and I think `$` looks nicer and so I'd prefer widely things to look nicer.
